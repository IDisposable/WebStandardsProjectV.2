# WebStandardsProjectV.2

Planning for a renewal of a large force of Web developers, web designers, UX, UI, #a11y, #Javascript #ecmascript #webdev #webdesign #opensource #openbook #openorg #opendata #gnuLgv3

I would first like to see who shows up to the group and expresses interest and introduces (or expands) on all issues related to the building of accessible, private, SECURE user-controlled opensource and openWeb. This includes all languages and techniques sinc3 1993, an examination of our common ideas and value systems through discourse and ultimately, action items and activism.

Please feel free to submit Issues, Projects, Insights and I absolutely encourage the use of the Wiki for idea share and organization.

Thank you so much for reading! I hope to be widening and learning from you all soon. xo/m
